API Management
Token Access (HTTP Token Authentication)
Enable REST API using tokens (not username/email address and password). All users need to create their own access tokens in the user profile.

Example:

curl -H "Authorization: Token token=â€¦" http://172.24.57.66:8080/api/v1/groups
Password Access (HTTP Basic Authentication)
Enable REST API access using the username/email address and password for the authentication user.

Example:

curl -u ashrestha@capstone.local:some_password http://172.24.57.66:8080/api/v1/groups
Applications (OAuth Authentication)
 
Manage applications that can use Zammad as an OAuth provider and applications that you've authorized to use your account.
